## Model 2: Consider home team advantage ----
#' The second model is a refinement of Model 1 which also considers home team advantage.
#' 
#' The outcome of the model is defined as the number of goals scored for the home and
#' visiting teams, respectively.
#' 
#' The model starts by making the following assumptions about the priors:
#' - The number of goals in a match for both teams is Poisson distributed.
#' - The lambda parameter to the Poisson distribution is equal to the exponential
#'   of some baseline plus some skill parameter of the scoring team, minus the skill
#'   parameter of the defending team.
#' - The baseline measures the same thing as in model 1; however, it is divided into a
#'   home baseline and an away baseline to account for home team advantage.
#'   Both baselines are assumed to be normally distributed with an expected value of 0 and 
#'   a standard deviation of 4. NOTE that since the lambda parameter measures things
#'   on the log scale, this actually covers a goal range from 0 to 54.6 goals!
#' - The skill parameter is normally distributed with an expected value of some mew
#'   parameter and a standard deviation of some sigma parameter.
#' - The mew parameter is assumed to be normally distributed among the teams with
#'   an expected value of 0 and a standard deviation of 4. 
#' - The sigma parameter is assumed to be uniformly distributed among the teams with
#'   min=0 and max=3.
#'   
#' Due to the way JAGS is constructed, the sigma parameter has to be translated to a
#' tau parameter in order to be usable in the model. tau is set to 1/(sigma^2).
#' 
#' These parameters and the assumptions underlying them are described in a slightly
#' more thorough fashion at:
